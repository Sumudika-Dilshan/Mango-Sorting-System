- Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye or newer)
- GPIO access permissions
```

### Dependencies Installation
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For PLC communication (choose based on your setup)
pip install pyserial          # For serial communication
pip install pymodbus          # For Ethernet/Modbus TCP
```

### Hardware Setup
1. **Camera Connection**: Connect USB cameras to Raspberry Pi USB ports
2. **GPIO Wiring**: Connect photoelectric sensor to GPIO pin 18
3. **PLC Communication**: Configure serial/Ethernet connection to PLC
4. **Power Supply**: Ensure adequate power for all components

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration
Edit `config.py` to match your hardware setup:

```python
# Camera settings
CAMERA1_INDEX = 0           # First camera device index
CAMERA2_INDEX = 1           # Second camera device index

# Timing parameters (seconds)
CAMERA1_DELAY = 2.0         # Delay for first camera capture
CAMERA2_DELAY = 3.0         # Delay for second camera capture

# PLC communication
PLC_PORT = '/dev/ttyUSB0'   # Serial port for PLC
PLC_BAUDRATE = 9600         # Communication baud rate
```

### Color Threshold Calibration
Use the included calibration tool for optimal performance:

```bash
# Run calibration with sample images
python calibration_tool.py /path/to/sample/images

# Interactive controls:
# - Adjust HSV thresholds using trackbars
# - Mark samples: R=Ripe, S=Semi-ripe, U=Unripe, D=Defect
# - Save configuration: C key
```

## Usage

### Running the System
```bash
# Start the main sorting system
python main.py

# The system will:
# 1. Initialize cameras and sensors
# 2. Connect to PLC
# 3. Wait for mango detection
# 4. Process and classify mangoes
# 5. Send sorting commands to PLC
```

### System Operation Flow
1. **Detection**: Photoelectric sensor detects approaching mango
2. **Image Capture**: Dual cameras capture images with precise timing
3. **Analysis**: Computer vision algorithms analyze color and defects
4. **Classification**: Mango classified into ripeness/quality categories
5. **Sorting**: PLC receives command and activates appropriate pneumatic cylinder
6. **Logging**: Results logged for quality control and system monitoring

## Algorithm Details

### Color Feature Extraction
The system uses HSV color space for robust color analysis:

```python
# Key color features extracted:
- Average Hue (H): Primary color information
- Average Saturation (S): Color intensity
- Average Value (V): Brightness information
- Standard Deviation: Color uniformity measure
```

### Defect Detection
Morphological image processing techniques identify defects:

```python
# Defect detection process:
1. Grayscale conversion
2. Threshold segmentation for dark spots
3. Morphological opening for noise removal
4. Contour analysis for defect quantification
5. Area-based severity assessment
```

### Classification Logic
Multi-criteria classification using calibrated thresholds:

```python
# Classification criteria:
- Hue range analysis for ripeness stage
- Saturation thresholds for quality assessment
- Defect area limits for acceptance/rejection
- Combined dual-camera confidence scoring
```

python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.VideoCapture(0).read()[0])"
```

#### PLC Communication Errors
```bash
# Check serial connection
ls /dev/ttyUSB*

# Test PLC communication
python -c "import serial; s=serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600); print(s.is_open)"
```
